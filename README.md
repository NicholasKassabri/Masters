# Masters

This repository contains two major projects completed as part of my Master’s in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Data Science at Carleton University:

Contents:

1. Thesis – A cognitive modeling project examining strategic behavior and decision-making in a simple zero-sum game.

2. Data Science Course Project – A project predicting loan default risk based on customer behavior. 

Each project has its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` that provides further details.
