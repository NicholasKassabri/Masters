# Masters

This repository contains two major projects completed as part of my Master’s in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Data Science at Carleton University:

Contents:
	1.	Thesis – A cognitive modeling project examining strategic behavior and decision-making in zero-sum games using a minimalist architecture.
	2.	Data Science Course Project – A project predicting loan default risk based on customer behavior. The project compares multiple classification models, including logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate performance and improve financial risk assessment.

Each project has its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` that provides further details.
