This project was completed as part of a graduate-level data science course and focuses on predicting loan default risk using customer behavior data. The analysis involves building and comparing several machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and an artificial neural network (ANN), to identify the most effective approach for financial risk assessment. The pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics. The final model, a tuned Random Forest, achieved the highest performance, demonstrating the value of data-driven decision-making in lending contexts.
