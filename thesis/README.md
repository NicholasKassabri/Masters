This sub-repository contains three Python codes developed for my Master’s thesis titled “Exploring Cognitive AI-Driven Computational Dynamics of Simple Zero-Sum Games.” The project investigates how memory lag-based agents engage in strategic play in the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The cognitive architecture used was inspired by ACT-R principles and allows the separation of parameters to systematically explore how agents with different memory strategies (Lag1 vs. Lag2) adapt over time. The simulation captures learning, forgetting, and decision-making under constraints such as capped memory utility, minimum memory utility, and noise. Results are automatically saved to an Excel file and accompanied by visualizations showing performance trends across games and rounds. This thesis demonstrates that a cognitive computational architecture and biologically plausible constraints can produce rich, emergent behavior in dynamic environments, making it a valuable tool for studying decision-making, strategy, and cognitive limitations in dynamic contexts.

**To run the simulations, you must first download the EPINGEN computational modeling architecture from the official repository: https://github.com/rlwest/epiNgen. Once downloaded, add the files from this sub-repository into the EPINGEN folder. You can then modify the parameters and run the simulations to explore different dynamic interactions.**
